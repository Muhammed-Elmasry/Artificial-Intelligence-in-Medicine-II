## Preparation

This section sets up the environment and ensures all necessary tools and libraries are available for the task.

## Installation of Dependencies

We use several Python packages for this task, including `datasets`, `tokenizers`, `transformers`, and `stanza`.

## Downloading Datasets
We utilize two main datasets: the OPEN-I dataset and a transcriptions dataset.

## Data Preprocessing
This section involves loading and preprocessing the datasets. Specific steps include data cleaning, tokenization, and preparing the data for model training.

## Model Training
We train various NLP models using the preprocessed data. This section details the models used, the training process, and any hyperparameter tuning performed.

## Evaluation
After training the models, we evaluate their performance using appropriate metrics. This section includes the evaluation results and any analysis performed to understand the model's performance.

## Results
The final section presents the results of the task, including any visualizations, tables, or summaries that highlight the outcomes of the model training and evaluation.

## Running the Notebook
To run the notebook, ensure you have all dependencies installed and datasets downloaded. Open the NLP.ipynb file in Jupyter Notebook and execute the cells sequentially.
